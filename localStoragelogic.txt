localStorage is a way for storing data in a broswer across multiple web pages
and it stays that way even after refreshing or leaving the page and coming back 

set data 

localStorage.setItem("Score",3)

"score" -> This is the label under which you are storing your data.

3 -> This is the value you are storing.

get data 

localStorage.getItem("score")

-> getting it back with the label
-> get item doesnt print anything 

let Score = parseInt(localStorage.getItem("Score")) || 0;

get returns string thats why we convert to int for calculations
This allows us to set Score to 0 initially and then lets us update later on 

we cannot use set as we instead of get here as we will be referencing Score even before it exists.

thats why we use get instead of set.

gets will initially score as 0 as we have not yet defined it but later on in fxns will give us the value of score.
