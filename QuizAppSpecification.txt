Awesome! Based on these topics and your interest in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, here's a fun and educational project idea that ties them together:

---

## 💡 **Project Question:**  
**Can you build a "Simple Quiz App" that tests users on basic JavaScript concepts?**

---

## 🧩 **Features your site should include:**

### 📄 **HTML:**
- A clean layout with:
  - A **start screen** with a "Start Quiz" button.
  - A **quiz screen** with:
    - A question
    - 3-4 answer choices (radio buttons or buttons)
    - A “Next” button
  - A **results screen** showing the user’s score and a “Restart Quiz” button.

---

### 🧠 **JavaScript (Use these concepts):**
- **Variables** to track the current question and score.
- **Arithmetic operators** to calculate the score.
- **If statements** or **switches** to check answers and give feedback.
- **Ternary operator** to show a quick "Correct!" or "Wrong!" response.
- **Loops** to display questions one by one.
- **String methods/slicing** to style or format question text if needed.
- **Logical operators** and **strict equality** for accurate answer checking.
- Optional: Accept **user input** like a name and display it in the final results.

### 🎨 **CSS Styling Instructions:**

#### 📱 Layout & Theme
- Use **Flexbox or Grid** for layout.
- Responsive design: should work on mobile and desktop.
- Set a **light or dark mode theme** using CSS variables.
  
#### 🎨 Colors
- Background: `#f4f4f4` (light theme) or `#121212` (dark theme)
- Primary color: `#4CAF50` for buttons
- Accent: `#FF9800` for highlights

#### 📦 Components Styling
- **Buttons:**
  - Rounded corners (`border-radius: 8px`)
  - Smooth hover effect (`transition: 0.3s`, change background on hover)
- **Quiz container:**
  - Max-width: `600px`, centered with `margin: auto`
  - Padding: `2rem`
  - Soft box shadow for depth
- **Typography:**
  - Font: `"Poppins", sans-serif`
  - Headings: bold, 1.5–2rem
  - Question text: slightly larger (1.2rem)
  
#### 💫 Animation/Interaction
- Add a **fade-in animation** when new questions appear.
- Show a green border if the answer is correct, red if wrong.
